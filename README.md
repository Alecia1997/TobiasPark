## TOBIAS PARK
Is an educational mobile game where users can learn about algorithmic bias through a story-based metaphoric context. The proposed mobile game is inspired by the puzzle game Where’s Wally?. The goal of the Where’s Wally? puzzle game is for the player to analyse a crowded scene where Wally is hidden and find him. This puzzle game is fun yet can be time consuming. The aforementioned inspired me to create an AI application that can help to detect a specific object, figure or character using machine learning. Furthermore the goal of the project is to explore how an algorithmic bias result can be presented as a result of a training data bias. A training data bias is when there is unrepresentative or incomplete data.

My game, which is an Android application, will ask the player to help a creature in Tobias Park called Penko find his friends Mash and Beau by using the AI technology object detection. The player is prompted to scan an image where Mash and Beau are hidden. 

The game presents an algorithmic bias result when only one type of creature is found by the AI and another is not, due to a training data bias. The player is encouraged to correct the bias by choosing and accumulating the necessary training data of the ‘left out’ creature, for the algorithmic model. With help from Penko, this additional missing data will ensure that the AI can then detect both of Penko’s friends and that no bias is presented. The game also acts as an educational context as the user is gradually informed of the bias and facilitated to correct it.

## HOW TO RUN IT
1.Create miniconda environment. 
2.Install Tensorflow ( Create python 3.6 environment for Tensorflow)
3.Place android folder in following directory: 
Miniconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/examples
4.Open android folder in Android Studio and run.
